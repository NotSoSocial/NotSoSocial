- 👋 Hi, I’m @NotSoSocial
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine learning, Ai, and other programming topics. I am familiar with Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and C++. However, my main focus has been on Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and completing my B.S. in Cybersecurity. I hold several certifications including Security+, Network+, and Pentest+ to name a few. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. I am a dedicated self study and advocate for my own learning. I lack mostly in experience working with other developers. I would be open to all oppurtinities to work with others. 
- 📫 How to reach me: the best way to reach me is through my Discord. My username is NotSoSocial#5838
